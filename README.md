alarm
=====

This project is a simple alarm that I was designing to make a little pop up window appear and then beep until you click "Stop the beeps!

I wanted this to be something that could let you know something was finished that wasn't an email, in case a user didn't have their email open or handy. 

I need to finish this and generate tone for the beeps.
